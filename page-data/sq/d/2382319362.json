When I cloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost noped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even adding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending… hours? figuring out which version of which router works with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to Webpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">react-snapshot</a>, which apparently builds static files for you? But there's still a <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I opened them.</li>\n<li>…once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if I wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app static routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving up. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did, which was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\" into my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into unique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code> with anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit message. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt the project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of each page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit. But I think an extra kilobyte will be tolerated by the 3 people who ever visit this corner of my website.</p>\n<p>And wow it was so easy. And if I ever decide to add a new sketch, I can do the same simple steps by hand. No dependency mismatch with my local versions. No reading old docs.

I took a lot of inspiration from my former Khan Academy teammate <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Josh W. Comeau’s dark mode post</a>, with a few differences.</p>\n<p>UI-wise, I decided to go a different route than a binary toggle between dark and light. There were three motivations behind this. From most to least important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I wanted to include a “system” option. Theming is still a fresh concept for most web users, so I think it’s worthwhile to expose a way to control theme, motion, brightness etc from within the webpage. But <a href=\"https://kilianvalkhof.com/2020/design/your-dark-mode-toggle-is-broken\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">there should <em>always</em> be a simple way to revert back to your system’s display preferences</a>.</li>\n<li>I may add more options later (greyscale? low-res? melty??) and this leaves my options open and unlimited.</li>\n<li>I liked the animated eyeball idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Speaking of the animated eyeball… I’m happy with how it turned out! It was quite a deep dive, since I didn’t want to include a heavy animation library like <a href=\"https://www.react-spring.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">react-spring</a> (&gt;25kb) or <a href=\"https://www.framer.com/motion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Framer Motion</a> (&gt;90kb). <strong>Thankfully, the coolest thing I learned while working on this feature is that <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/guide-svg-animations-smil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SVG has a declarative animation specification called SMIL</a>!</strong> It didn’t take long to pick up, and it’s very easy to work with. I’m really happy to add it to my toolkit.</p>\n<p>Animations were the <em>coolest</em> deep dive, but they weren’t the deepest. Back when I started building this website, I split the header into Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow (CMY) channels. They <a href=\"/blog/your-art-teacher-lied\">combined subtractively</a> to make a black-ish color, which I used across the site for text. I removed that feature in late 2019, but recently added it back.</p>\n<p>With a single theme, that’s three combinations, for a total of 7 colors. With two themes… the combinations explode a bit.</p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mix-blend-modes</a> to combine colors, of which there are limited options. For my initial color palettes, I wanted to pick three pretty primary colors (light: CMY, dark: RGB) that would blend into three pretty secondary colors (light: RGB, dark: CMY), and all blend together into something with enough contrast from the background to use as body text. Tall order! <a href=\"https://github.com/rileyjshaw/palette-test-tool\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">So I built a tool for that</a>, and spent a few idle hours tweaking settings until I was happy.</p>\n<p>And the initial palettes are… pretty good? I wish I was more thrilled with the result, but there are so many conflicting requirements that it’s impossible to get a result as good as if I’d hand-picked the colors independently. I’ve done an initial a11y pass of the colors, and there are some areas of the site where I want to improve the contrast. So I’ll probably end up with a palette split between the “true” colors, and their slightly modified, more attractive cousins.</p>\n<p>I also needed to add a global settings provider in this commit. Now that I’ve done the work for that, look forward to more settings (reduce motion, contrast preference, block embeds… cheat codes??) coming soon!</p>\n<p>I made a few minor changes while working on this commit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update a bunch of the site doodles to fit either theme.</li>\n<li>Share theme colors between CSS-land and JS-land. No more mismatches!</li>\n<li>Keep the <code>&lt;Layout&gt;</code> component mounted between pages. Transitions and performance will be just <em>sliiightly</em> smoother.</li>\n<li>Clarify the color variables a bit; <code>--cb</code> is now <code>--color-blue</code>. - Add theme-dynamic color variables. For instance, <code>--color-p1</code> (“primary one”) maps to <code>--color-red</code> in dark mode and <code>--color-cyan</code> in light mode.</li>\n<li>Update some non-standard colors (eg. scaling faders demo) to fit the new palettes.</li>\n<li>Super simplify state-handling in the site nav (fixes a persistent console error).</li>\n<li>Standardize the handling of <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>","image":null,"more":true,"extraData":null},{"uid":"COMMIT_20C08F1F73C6A69CD5B6135C036FBEA969208A58","type":"commit","title":"Improved version for 2021","coolness":null,"date":"2021-02-18","link":"https://rileyjshaw.commit--blog.com/rileyjshaw/palette-test-tool/20c08f1f73c6a69cd5b6135c036fbea969208a58","description":"<p>I recently added a color channel splitter back into my site header, so I dusted off this project.

Keeping my data entirely separate from the from the site's framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this directory. It's just a few JS files!</p>\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code> directory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\n<li>…etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development.

Locking into a static stylesheet added some huge copypastas, tripling the size of main.css.\n- Injected stylesheets aren't accessible once they've been added. Rather than \"turning the styles off\" like in 2), the best option was to add a toggle class to &lt;body&gt;.\n- Rewrites take time.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This commit was essentially a full rewrite, so I changed some smaller things while I was at it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Styles now look for :not(.off) instead of .on. This makes the default dark and avoids a Blinding White Flash before the class changes.</li>\n<li>Added id specificity helpers; it's discussed further in client.js:24.</li>\n<li>Renamed some files for clarity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I came across some unfortunate Chromium bugs while working on this, which caused me to dive into that project.

what&rsquo;s important to convey?</p><p>the shapes are curvy and strange, so it&rsquo;s easier to share a limited reference table of basic + advanced shapes instead of deriving each part of the bear from scratch. three bits could cover 125 shapes, which is  ample for bear and bear-like drawings.</p><p>shapes are more reusable if they can be drawn at different sizes. let&rsquo;s use one bit to indicate size:</p><p>0: smallest<br/>1: smaller<br/>2: as shown on reference table<br/>3: larger<br/>4: largest</p><p>we&rsquo;re trying to convey a cohesive bear, so the relative position between shapes is more important than their absolute position on the page. two bits can express position in relation to the last shape drawn, for example:</p><p>0: draw in any open space<br/>1: draw connected to the north-most edge of the previous shape<br/>2: draw connected to the northeast-most edge of the previous shape<br/>3: draw connected to the east-most edge of the previous shape<br/>4: draw connected to the southeast-most edge of the previous shape<br/>5: draw connected to the south-most edge of the previous shape<br/>&hellip;<br/>9: continue from shape&rsquo;s final pen position<br/>10: continue from shape&rsquo;s initial pen position<br/>&hellip;<br/>15: draw within the previous shape<br/>16: draw surrounding the previous shape<br/>&hellip;<br/>etc.</p><p>since pen position is a factor, the shape reference table should imply direction.</p><p>to save time, a bit could be added to indicate how many shapes should be drawn at the specified position. for example, there are four toes in each bear foot.</p><hr><p>when ordering the bits, it makes sense to think of what information is most useful to the receiver at each step. my intuition is that this is a good order:</p><p>•• position<br/>• number<br/>• size<br/>••• shape</p><p>so each shape takes seven sounds from the sender.</p><hr><p>update: i ran this by phil; they made the point that since there&rsquo;s no acknowledgment channel from the receiver, redundancy would help reduce errors. let&rsquo;s add a bit at the beginning to indicate whether this is the initial message or a confirmation message. the following 7 bits will then be identical.</p><hr><p>update 2: in the above system, a single missed bit would be catastrophic; it would corrupt the receiver&rsquo;s understanding of all future communication. the (initial | confirmation) sound should be unique so it always marks the start of a new shape. dragging the (cup | ball) in a double circle works.</p>","image":null,"more":true,"extraData":null},{"uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171298312372","type":"tumblr","title":"metropolis","coolness":null,"date":"2018-02-26","link":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171298312372/metropolis","description":"<p>i

And you’re awesome 💕<br/></p><hr><h2>Why do you want to study at SFPC at this point in your life?<br/></h2><p>I love making art! But when I use computers, I can get distracted by Technical Shinys. I also get distracted by Expectations, especially around my Engineering Career.</p><p>In 2014 I was working at a startup without a purpose whatsoever. I left to join Khan Academy, a free education nonprofit. I felt good about that.</p><p>A few years have gone by and I feel a similar pull. I&rsquo;ve lost my idealism for nonprofits; they&rsquo;re subject to the same restrictive evaluation metrics and organizational patterns as any corporation.</p><p>(Dang, that sucks.)</p><p>I see art as a way to effect change outside of the rigid hierarchical structures of Work. It&rsquo;s a chance to connect on a different level; to surprise, engage, and hopefully, to shine light on something better.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to recalibrate… again. I wrote a little poem called &ldquo;whoami&rdquo; below. I want to work with more expressive languages.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>#!/usr/bin/env python<br/>from subprocess import Popen as ask, PIPE as rain; for_truth_in = bool</p><p>id  = &lsquo;my&rsquo; in'stinctual impulse&rsquo;<br/>for all_my_be in'g&rsquo;:<br/>    there = 'more to&rsquo;.find(&ldquo;) - (id is not 'critical&rsquo; or 'moralizing&rsquo;)<br/>superego = there</p><p>ego = i = ask('whoami&rsquo;, stdout=rain)<br/>for days in ['the rain&rsquo;]: i = i.stdout</p><p>reflection = (word for word in [<br/>    'oh, the places you'll go&rsquo; in 'the summer&rsquo;,<br/>    'the art of electronics&rsquo; in 'uni&rsquo;,<br/>    'the lean startup&rsquo; in 'my dark days&rsquo;,<br/>    'the one room schoolhouse&rsquo; in 'that idealistic edtech phase&rsquo;,<br/>    &rdquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    &rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/>    'and so on.&rsquo;<br/>])</p><p>found = not 'yet&rsquo;</p><p>while not found:<br/>    found = i.read(for_truth_in(next(reflection)))</p><p>i = found + ego.communicate()[id][:superego]<br/>print i</p><hr><h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be?</h2><p>APPROACHING IDEAS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS<br/>=====================================</p><p>I&rsquo;m familiar with some of the technical methods we&rsquo;ll cover over the term. This is exciting; re-approaching them intentionally through an artistic lens might help me break forgotten assumptions. So rather than focusing on *how* to build a Markov chain, I want to explore *why* I&rsquo;d build one.</p><p>I went to Recurse Center in 2014 because I wanted to collaborate with people outside of rigid project structures. I want to explore and build new frameworks now. I hope SFPC can help me rebuild my conceptions around the words &ldquo;technical&rdquo;, &ldquo;art&rdquo;, and &ldquo;project&rdquo;.</p><p>A STUDY IN EDUCATION<br/>====================</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years learning about education. I&rsquo;ve formed opinions and have even more questions now. I&rsquo;m interested in programs like SFPC that challenge the rigidity of institutional CS or Fine Arts programs.</p><p>I also love mentorship. I lead our formal mentorship program at Khan Academy, and teach as a volunteer at a few local organizations. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll learn more from my cohort than they learn from me, but when it&rsquo;s helpful I&rsquo;d like to pitch in.</p><p>ULTIMATELY,<br/>===========</p><p>I&rsquo;m excited to develop my artistic practice around folks that I&rsquo;ve admired for a really, really long time &lt;3</p><hr><h2>What would you like to make at SFPC?</h2><p>As you can see on <a href=\"/lab\">rileyjshaw.com/lab</a>, I&rsquo;ve made many little things. These days, I try to work slower. Rather than approaching SFPC with plans to create specific artifacts, I&rsquo;m more interested in the process. I would like to refine the way that I absorb and synthesize ideas. I want to listen a lot and make slow, deliberate progress toward this goal.</p><p>Here are some topics that I&rsquo;m interested in:</p><p>EDUCATION AND THE REINFORCEMENT OF CLASS STRUCTURES<br/>===================================================</p><p>Our formal education system creates adults who can&rsquo;t take care of themselves, and whose survival depends on capitalist class structures. Educated and non-educated citizens are trapped in this cycle. A post-class society needs modes of education that break these rigidly imposed hierarchies. What might that look like?</p><p>DELETION, PERMANENCE, AND CONSISTENCY<br/>=====================================</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to store data because it entrenches people in their past behaviors. Corporate culture&rsquo;s emphasis on consistency is ableist, colonizing, transphobic, and represents a growing discomfort with people&rsquo;s fluidity.</p><p>I hope someday to have an International Day of Deletion. How can we live more presently?</p><p>CORPORATE TOOLS<br/>===============</p><p>A Craigslist bot gives Sol LeWitt-style instructions to a community. A series of banner ads discourage consumerism. Challenging people&rsquo;s expectations around advertising and corporate tools may raise questions about the structures behind them.</p><p>Mechanical Turk, Google Ads, Ebay, promoted tweets… these tools enforce the goals and values of capitalism. Can they be used to break them?</p><p>MAKING FRIENDS!!!<br/>=================</p><p>I am especially excited for the chance to meet new people that I can work with deeply. Festivals like XOXO or Eyeo allow only fleeting glimpses of fellow weirdos. Collaborating and growing together as a cohort – supporting and challenging one-another – is what I&rsquo;m most excited about.</p><p>In every education program I&rsquo;ve been a part of so far, people have been the most important part.</p><hr><p>Well, that’s it. I was initially accepted into the Fall 2017 batch but deferred to finish  some important work at Khan Academy and transition stewardship of the programs I was looking after. In the past half-year I’ve learned a lot and changed a lot, and my application would look different if I were to write it today. But the heart of this – writing less code, more thoughtfully – is at least as true today as it was when I wrote this.<br/></p>","image":null,"more":true,"extraData":null},{"uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171435153227","type":"tumblr","title":"Oh, And Speaking Of Consistency...","coolness":null,"date":"2018-03-02","link":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171435153227/oh-and-speaking-of-consistency","description":"<p>I’m capitalizing words sometimes now.
