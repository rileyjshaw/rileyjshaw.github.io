But the instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed.

The very same process in which capitalists and technocrats were freed to make technical decisions without regard for the needs of workers and communities generated a wealth of new “values,” ethical demands forced to seek voice dis-cursively. Most fundamentally, democratization of technology is about finding new ways of privileging these excluded values and realizing them in the new technical arrangements.","author":null,"source":"Critical Theory of Technology: An Overview","cite":"https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171126377257/the-larger-implication-of-this-approach-has-to-do"},{"uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171127763052","content":"Characteristically, a technocratic notion of modernity inspires a positioning of the user that sharply restricts potential initiative, while a democratic conception enlarges initiative in more complex virtual worlds.","author":null,"source":"Critical Theory of Technology: An Overview","cite":"https://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/books/critbio.pdf","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171127763052/characteristically-a-technocratic-notion-of"},{"uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171128489545","content":"the work of past ages accumulates, and is remade again","author":"Osamu Sato","source":null,"cite":"https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Osamu+Sato%22","relatedLink":"https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171128489545/the-work-of-past-ages-accumulates-and-is-remade"},{"uid":"SFPC_TUMBLR_171149535302","content":"The increased deployment of nuclear power facilities must lead society toward authoritarianism.
