When I cloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost noped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even adding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending‚Ä¶ hours? figuring out which version of which router works with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to Webpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">react-snapshot</a>, which apparently builds static files for you? But there's still a <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I opened them.</li>\n<li>‚Ä¶once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if I wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app static routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving up. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did, which was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\" into my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into unique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code> with anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit message. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt the project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of each page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit. But I think an extra kilobyte will be tolerated by the 3 people who ever visit this corner of my website.</p>\n<p>And wow it was so easy. And if I ever decide to add a new sketch, I can do the same simple steps by hand. No dependency mismatch with my local versions. No reading old docs. Just build, drag, repeat, forever.</p>\n<p>I guess I'm writing this as a reminder to myself: it's usually possible to break back out to 1995 in a pinch.</p>",

I remember finding a way to apply a black background to Microsoft Word 2003, then being horrified when I accidentally printed the document.

One of my only lasting contributions to <a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/blog/the-pool-on-the-roof-must-have-a-leak\" rel=\"nofollow\">Signal</a> was loudly advocating for dark mode on iOS and Desktop, not just Android. I even <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-theme-everywhere/nibjplbnmmklkfnkpecgbffkifmdbjed\" rel=\"nofollow\">made a browser extension in 2015</a> to apply a dark theme to the entire Internet.</p>\n<p>It‚Äôs not the most pressing or exciting work, but I decided my site should have a dark theme of its own. I took a lot of inspiration from my former Khan Academy teammate <a href=\"https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Josh W. Comeau‚Äôs dark mode post</a>, with a few differences.</p>\n<p>UI-wise, I decided to go a different route than a binary toggle between dark and light. There were three motivations behind this. From most to least important:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I wanted to include a ‚Äúsystem‚Äù option. Theming is still a fresh concept for most web users, so I think it‚Äôs worthwhile to expose a way to control theme, motion, brightness etc from within the webpage. But <a href=\"https://kilianvalkhof.com/2020/design/your-dark-mode-toggle-is-broken\" rel=\"nofollow\">there should <em>always</em> be a simple way to revert back to your system‚Äôs display preferences</a>.</li>\n<li>I may add more options later (greyscale? low-res? melty??) and this leaves my options open and unlimited.</li>\n<li>I liked the animated eyeball idea.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Speaking of the animated eyeball‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy with how it turned out! It was quite a deep dive, since I didn‚Äôt want to include a heavy animation library like <a href=\"https://www.react-spring.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">react-spring</a> (&gt;25kb) or <a href=\"https://www.framer.com/motion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Framer Motion</a> (&gt;90kb). <strong>Thankfully, the coolest thing I learned while working on this feature is that <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/guide-svg-animations-smil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SVG has a declarative animation specification called SMIL</a>!</strong> It didn‚Äôt take long to pick up, and it‚Äôs very easy to work with. I‚Äôm really happy to add it to my toolkit.</p>\n<p>Animations were the <em>coolest</em> deep dive, but they weren‚Äôt the deepest. Back when I started building this website, I split the header into Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow (CMY) channels. They <a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/blog/your-art-teacher-lied\" rel=\"nofollow\">combined subtractively</a> to make a black-ish color, which I used across the site for text. I removed that feature in late 2019, but recently added it back.</p>\n<p>With a single theme, that‚Äôs three combinations, for a total of 7 colors. With two themes‚Ä¶ the combinations explode a bit.</p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode\" rel=\"nofollow\">mix-blend-modes</a> to combine colors, of which there are limited options. For my initial color palettes, I wanted to pick three pretty primary colors (light: CMY, dark: RGB) that would blend into three pretty secondary colors (light: RGB, dark: CMY), and all blend together into something with enough contrast from the background to use as body text. Tall order! <a href=\"https://github.com/rileyjshaw/palette-test-tool\">So I built a tool for that</a>, and spent a few idle hours tweaking settings until I was happy.</p>\n<p>And the initial palettes are‚Ä¶ pretty good? I wish I was more thrilled with the result, but there are so many conflicting requirements that it‚Äôs impossible to get a result as good as if I‚Äôd hand-picked the colors independently. I‚Äôve done an initial a11y pass of the colors, and there are some areas of the site where I want to improve the contrast. So I‚Äôll probably end up with a palette split between the ‚Äútrue‚Äù colors, and their slightly modified, more attractive cousins.</p>\n<p>I also needed to add a global settings provider in this commit. Now that I‚Äôve done the work for that, look forward to more settings (reduce motion, contrast preference, block embeds‚Ä¶ cheat codes??) coming soon!</p>\n<p>I made a few minor changes while working on this commit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update a bunch of the site doodles to fit either theme.</li>\n<li>Share theme colors between CSS-land and JS-land. No more mismatches!</li>\n<li>Keep the <code>&lt;Layout&gt;</code> component mounted between pages. Transitions and performance will be just <em>sliiightly</em> smoother.</li>\n<li>Clarify the color variables a bit; <code>--cb</code> is now <code>--color-blue</code>. -¬†Add theme-dynamic color variables. For instance, <code>--color-p1</code> (‚Äúprimary one‚Äù) maps to <code>--color-red</code> in dark mode and <code>--color-cyan</code> in light mode.</li>\n<li>Update some non-standard colors (eg. scaling faders demo) to fit the new palettes.</li>\n<li>Super simplify state-handling in the site nav (fixes a persistent console error).</li>\n<li>Standardize the handling of <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>",

		"body": "<h1>Project scraper</h1>\n<p>The projects on my site are automatically scraped and formatted at publish time using the scripts in this directory. Read more about my reasoning below, or skip to the <a href=\"#structure\">directory structure</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby's source and transformer plugins are powerful, and I used them in the initial development of this site. I eventually decided that separating my collection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\n<p>GraphQL's filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby's APIs add more options for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated or non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of Gatsby's ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off treatment of specific content nodes,</p>\n<h3>Control</h3>\n<p>I've had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to another platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the from the site's framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this directory. It's just a few JS files!</p>\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code> directory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\n<li>‚Ä¶etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development. At best this meant I was pinging APIs and atom feeds more than necessary. At worst, it made working offline with project data impossible.</p>\n<h2>Directory structure</h2>\n<p>Here's how the scraper is organized for now:</p>\n<pre><code>scrape-projects.js\n\tThe megafile to replace Gatsby's source plugins. This pulls project data\n\tfrom all online sources and saves them into `_generated/`.\n\n_generated/\n\tFiles generated by the `scrape-projects.js` above. DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES\n\tMANUALLY! They will be overwritten.\n\n\tscraped-projects-raw.json\n\t\tNot quite the raw response, but pretty close. This file\n\t\tcontains all the data that I may decide to use someday, but\n\t\thaven't yet.

Locking into a static stylesheet added some huge copypastas, tripling the size of main.css.\n- Injected stylesheets aren't accessible once they've been added. Rather than \"turning the styles off\" like in 2), the best option was to add a toggle class to &lt;body&gt;.\n- Rewrites take time.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>This commit was essentially a full rewrite, so I changed some smaller things while I was at it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Styles now look for :not(.off) instead of .on. This makes the default dark and avoids a Blinding White Flash before the class changes.</li>\n<li>Added id specificity helpers; it's discussed further in client.js:24.</li>\n<li>Renamed some files for clarity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I came across some unfortunate Chromium bugs while working on this, which caused me to dive into that project. It's huge! Lots of fun to poke around :)</p>",

But when I use computers, I can get distracted by Technical Shinys. I also get distracted by Expectations, especially around my Engineering Career.</p><p>In 2014 I was working at a startup without a purpose whatsoever. I left to join Khan Academy, a free education nonprofit. I felt good about that.</p><p>A few years have gone by and I feel a similar pull. I&rsquo;ve lost my idealism for nonprofits; they&rsquo;re subject to the same restrictive evaluation metrics and organizational patterns as any corporation.</p><p>(Dang, that sucks.)</p><p>I see art as a way to effect change outside of the rigid hierarchical structures of Work. It&rsquo;s a chance to connect on a different level; to surprise, engage, and hopefully, to shine light on something better.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to recalibrate‚Ä¶ again. I wrote a little poem called &ldquo;whoami&rdquo; below. I want to work with more expressive languages.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>#!/usr/bin/env python<br/>from subprocess import Popen as ask, PIPE as rain; for_truth_in = bool</p><p>id ¬†= &lsquo;my&rsquo; in'stinctual impulse&rsquo;<br/>for all_my_be in'g&rsquo;:<br/> ¬† ¬†there = 'more to&rsquo;.find(&ldquo;) - (id is not 'critical&rsquo; or 'moralizing&rsquo;)<br/>superego = there</p><p>ego = i = ask('whoami&rsquo;, stdout=rain)<br/>for days in ['the rain&rsquo;]: i = i.stdout</p><p>reflection = (word for word in [<br/> ¬† ¬†'oh, the places you'll go&rsquo; in 'the summer&rsquo;,<br/> ¬† ¬†'the art of electronics&rsquo; in 'uni&rsquo;,<br/> ¬† ¬†'the lean startup&rsquo; in 'my dark days&rsquo;,<br/> ¬† ¬†'the one room schoolhouse&rsquo; in 'that idealistic edtech phase&rsquo;,<br/> ¬† ¬†&rdquo;,<br/> ¬† ¬†&rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/> ¬† ¬†&rsquo;&rsquo;,<br/> ¬† ¬†'and so on.&rsquo;<br/>])</p><p>found = not 'yet&rsquo;</p><p>while not found:<br/> ¬† ¬†found = i.read(for_truth_in(next(reflection)))</p><p>i = found + ego.communicate()[id][:superego]<br/>print i</p><hr><h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be?</h2><p>APPROACHING IDEAS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS<br/>=====================================</p><p>I&rsquo;m familiar with some of the technical methods we&rsquo;ll cover over the term. This is exciting; re-approaching them intentionally through an artistic lens might help me break forgotten assumptions. So rather than focusing on *how* to build a Markov chain, I want to explore *why* I&rsquo;d build one.</p><p>I went to Recurse Center in 2014 because I wanted to collaborate with people outside of rigid project structures. I want to explore and build new frameworks now. I hope SFPC can help me rebuild my conceptions around the words &ldquo;technical&rdquo;, &ldquo;art&rdquo;, and &ldquo;project&rdquo;.</p><p>A STUDY IN EDUCATION<br/>====================</p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years learning about education. I&rsquo;ve formed opinions and have even more questions now. I&rsquo;m interested in programs like SFPC that challenge the rigidity of institutional CS or Fine Arts programs.</p><p>I also love mentorship. I lead our formal mentorship program at Khan Academy, and teach as a volunteer at a few local organizations. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll learn more from my cohort than they learn from me, but when it&rsquo;s helpful I&rsquo;d like to pitch in.</p><p>ULTIMATELY,<br/>===========</p><p>I&rsquo;m excited to develop my artistic practice around folks that I&rsquo;ve admired for a really, really long time &lt;3</p><hr><h2>What would you like to make at SFPC?</h2><p>As you can see on <a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/lab\">rileyjshaw.com/lab</a>, I&rsquo;ve made many little things. These days, I try to work slower. Rather than approaching SFPC with plans to create specific artifacts, I&rsquo;m more interested in the process. I would like to refine the way that I absorb and synthesize ideas. I want to listen a lot and make slow, deliberate progress toward this goal.</p><p>Here are some topics that I&rsquo;m interested in:</p><p>EDUCATION AND THE REINFORCEMENT OF CLASS STRUCTURES<br/>===================================================</p><p>Our formal education system creates adults who can&rsquo;t take care of themselves, and whose survival depends on capitalist class structures. Educated and non-educated citizens are trapped in this cycle. A post-class society needs modes of education that break these rigidly imposed hierarchies. What might that look like?</p><p>DELETION, PERMANENCE, AND CONSISTENCY<br/>=====================================</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to store data because it entrenches people in their past behaviors. Corporate culture&rsquo;s emphasis on consistency is ableist, colonizing, transphobic, and represents a growing discomfort with people&rsquo;s fluidity.</p><p>I hope someday to have an International Day of Deletion. How can we live more presently?</p><p>CORPORATE TOOLS<br/>===============</p><p>A Craigslist bot gives Sol LeWitt-style instructions to a community. A series of banner ads discourage consumerism. Challenging people&rsquo;s expectations around advertising and corporate tools may raise questions about the structures behind them.</p><p>Mechanical Turk, Google Ads, Ebay, promoted tweets‚Ä¶ these tools enforce the goals and values of capitalism. Can they be used to break them?</p><p>MAKING FRIENDS!!!<br/>=================</p><p>I am especially excited for the chance to meet new people that I can work with deeply. Festivals like XOXO or Eyeo allow only fleeting glimpses of fellow weirdos. Collaborating and growing together as a cohort ‚Äì supporting and challenging one-another ‚Äì is what I&rsquo;m most excited about.</p><p>In every education program I&rsquo;ve been a part of so far, people have been the most important part.</p><hr><p>Well, that‚Äôs it. I was initially accepted into the Fall 2017 batch but deferred to finish  some important work at Khan Academy and transition stewardship of the programs I was looking after. In the past half-year I‚Äôve learned a lot and changed a lot, and my application would look different if I were to write it today. But the heart of this ‚Äì writing less code, more thoughtfully ‚Äì is at least as true today as it was when I wrote this.<br/></p>",

i didn‚Äôt spoil the moment with a photo, but \nhopefully the photos in this post give some indication. we waited. after half a\n minute, the dial notched up slightly. then i noticed he was crying.</p><p>&ldquo;i didn&rsquo;t think i&rsquo;d be able to make it happier&rdquo;</p><p>he gave me a long, tight hug. i think he was still crying. \nhe said a few more words, but seemed to be choking over them, then \nwandered off, dazed. i wish so badly that i&rsquo;d asked if he was okay, \nhow he was doing, if he wanted to talk. it&rsquo;s a lesson i hope i remember. the piece is about making space and time for people, and \nthough it&rsquo;s not the artist&rsquo;s responsibility to be perfect all the time, i\n should strive to be as good as my art asks others to be.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/0b2af8263633a41433b905d2103d28bd/tumblr_inline_ph2ig8CKHA1vbjywz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p>as the space became more crowded, not everyone was willing to spend time\n with the piece. on day two i made tweaks entirely for &ldquo;gropers&rdquo;. i \nsped the piece up. i added another motor so that the dial spun back \nquicker and more reliably. i honed my spiel. i think these were good \nimprovements for the space, but it was also a compromise.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5760\" data-orig-height=\"3840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9cd269a79d5db30a9b0b8c695b5bf433/tumblr_inline_ph2hub5Sbo1vbjywz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5760\" data-orig-height=\"3840\"/></figure><p>in my ideal version of this piece, it takes 10 minutes of nurturing \nbefore the dial begins to move. the viewer would be sitting, alone, in a\n comfortable and intimate space. it&rsquo;s quiet, it takes a lot of time. the\n strongest reactions from day one resulted in tears and deep \ndiscussions, which was rare after i sped the piece up. quicker timing \nsmoothed out the reactions;
