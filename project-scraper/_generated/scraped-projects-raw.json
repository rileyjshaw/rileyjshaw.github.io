One of my only lasting contributions to <a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/blog/the-pool-on-the-roof-must-have-a-leak\" rel=\"nofollow\">Signal</a> was loudly advocating for dark mode on iOS and Desktop, not just Android. I even <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-theme-everywhere/nibjplbnmmklkfnkpecgbffkifmdbjed\" rel=\"nofollow\">made a browser extension in 2015</a> to apply a dark theme to the entire Internet.</p>\n<p>It’s not the most pressing or exciting work, but I decided my site should have a dark theme of its own.

Read more about my reasoning below, or<br>\nskip to the <a href=\"#structure\">directory structure</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby's source and transformer plugins are powerful, and I used them in the<br>\ninitial development of this site. I eventually decided that separating my<br>\ncollection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility</h3>\n<p>GraphQL's filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby's APIs add more<br>\noptions for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated<br>\nor non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of<br>\nGatsby's ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off<br>\ntreatment of specific content nodes,</p>\n<h3>Control</h3>\n<p>I've had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to<br>\nanother platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the<br>\nfrom the site's framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this<br>\ndirectory. It's just a few JS files!</p>\n<h3>Offline</h3>\n<p>Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the <code>.cache</code><br>\ndirectory by default. The <code>.cache</code> directory is deleted after:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>gatsby clean</code> is called.</li>\n<li><code>package.json</code> changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-config.js</code> changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.</li>\n<li><code>gatsby-node.js</code> changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.</li>\n<li>…etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found I was frequently triggering <code>.cache</code> wipes during development.

It worked for me!</p>\n<p>But I planned to eventually make an easier way to browse existing<br>\nexperiments.

I'm doing less browser-based creative coding<br>\nthese days, and trying to stretch my work in other directions.</p>\n<p>About an hour ago, I decided to create an index page or dropdown<br>\nto close this project out and keep it accessible in perpetuity. When I<br>\ncloned the repo and started looking at the build pipeline, I almost<br>\nnoped the whole idea. I built this with <code>create-react-app</code>, so even<br>\nadding new pages for each project <em>the recommended way</em> involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installing some sort of React-compliant router.</li>\n<li>Spending… hours? figuring out which version of which router<br>\nworks with the project's outdated dependencies, OR,</li>\n<li>Upgrading the entire project, likely involving major upgrades to<br>\nWebpack, Babel, etc.</li>\n<li>Installing something called <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-snapshot\" rel=\"nofollow\">react-snapshot</a>,<br>\nwhich apparently builds static files for you? But there's still<br>\na <code>pushState</code> history API? The README listed some tutorials, so I<br>\nopened them.</li>\n<li>…once I'd reached this point, I realized I'd need another method if<br>\nI wanted to be done within the hour.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At that point, I could have searched the web for \"create-react-app<br>\nstatic routes 2017 easy\" and gone down that rabbit hole before giving<br>\nup. OR, I could have given up immediately. Or I could do what I did,<br>\nwhich was a good idea:</p>\n<p>I changed the root component 38 times by hand, typed \"npm run build\"<br>\ninto my terminal by hand, and dragged the built files BY HAND into<br>\nunique directories that I created BY HAND.</p>\n<p>Gasp!</p>\n<p>I spent another minute in my editor surrounding the output of <code>ls -d</code><br>\nwith anchor tags for a root index. (yes, by hand)</p>\n<p>The most time-intensive part of the process was writing this commit<br>\nmessage. I'm confident if I'd tried to automate the process or rebuilt<br>\nthe project \"the right way\", I'd be at this for a few more hours.</p>\n<p>The result is a little sketchy. Namely, I'm sure the total payload of<br>\neach page is a bit bigger, and caching takes a hit. But I think an<br>\nextra kilobyte will be tolerated by the 3 people who ever visit this<br>\ncorner of my website.</p>\n<p>And wow it was so easy. And if I ever decide to add a new sketch, I<br>\ncan do the same simple steps by hand. No dependency mismatch with my<br>\nlocal versions. No reading old docs. Just build, drag, repeat,<br>\nforever.</p>\n<p>I guess I'm writing this as a reminder to myself: it's usually<br>\npossible to break back out to 1995 in a pinch.</p>",

Specifically,\nwrite(0) now corresponds to the standard min pulse width of 1000µs.\nwrite(90) now corresponds to the standard zero point pulse width, and aligns with the library's DEFAULT_PULSE_WIDTH variable.\nwrite(180) now corresponds to the standard max pulse width of 2000µs.\nTested on an Arduino Uno with a Tower Pro Micro Servo SG90, and a Parallax Feedback 360° High-Speed Servo.\n1: For example, http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/pcheung/teaching/DE1_EE/stores/sg90_datasheet.pdf\n2: For instance:\njulianduque/beaglebone-io#54\narduino-libraries#3\nhttps://toolguyd.com/oscilloscope-arduino-servo-pwm-signal-mistakes/\nhttps://makezine.com/2014/04/23/arduinos-servo-library-angles-microseconds-and-optional-command-parameters/\nI also see a lot of posts on https://forum.arduino.cc about this.\n3: There is actually no way to set a standard servo to the zero-point using write(angle); the closest you can get is write(92), for a pulse of 1504µs.",

i didn’t spoil the moment with a photo, but \nhopefully the photos in this post give some indication. we waited. after half a\n minute, the dial notched up slightly. then i noticed he was crying.</p><p>“i didn’t think i’d be able to make it happier”</p><p>he gave me a long, tight hug. i think he was still crying. \nhe said a few more words, but seemed to be choking over them, then \nwandered off, dazed. i wish so badly that i’d asked if he was okay, \nhow he was doing, if he wanted to talk. it’s a lesson i hope i remember. the piece is about making space and time for people, and \nthough it’s not the artist’s responsibility to be perfect all the time, i\n should strive to be as good as my art asks others to be.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/0b2af8263633a41433b905d2103d28bd/tumblr_inline_ph2ig8CKHA1vbjywz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\"></figure><p>as the space became more crowded, not everyone was willing to spend time\n with the piece. on day two i made tweaks entirely for “gropers”. i \nsped the piece up. i added another motor so that the dial spun back \nquicker and more reliably. i honed my spiel. i think these were good \nimprovements for the space, but it was also a compromise.<br></p><figure data-orig-width=\"5760\" data-orig-height=\"3840\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://64.media.tumblr.com/9cd269a79d5db30a9b0b8c695b5bf433/tumblr_inline_ph2hub5Sbo1vbjywz_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5760\" data-orig-height=\"3840\"></figure><p>in my ideal version of this piece, it takes 10 minutes of nurturing \nbefore the dial begins to move. the viewer would be sitting, alone, in a\n comfortable and intimate space. it’s quiet, it takes a lot of time. the\n strongest reactions from day one resulted in tears and deep \ndiscussions, which was rare after i sped the piece up. quicker timing \nsmoothed out the reactions;

					"content_raw": "<p>I’ve decided to post my response to the three questions SFPC asks potential participants.</p><p>Before I start any application process I try to learn as much as I can about the place. That involves learning about the folx involved. I hope this post helps a future SFPC attendee get started on their application.<br></p><p>If you’ve landed here from a search and are considering applying, I recommend doing so! It’s fun here and the people are nice.</p><hr><p><b>A disclaimer  before we get into it:</b> everyone who goes through SFPC comes from different backgrounds. If you see something on my application that you haven’t experienced, please don’t take it as a requirement. Batches are carefully selected to include different perspectives and skillsets. And you’re awesome 💕<br></p><hr><h2>Why do you want to study at SFPC at this point in your life?<br></h2><p>I love making art! But when I use computers, I can get distracted by Technical Shinys. I also get distracted by Expectations, especially around my Engineering Career.</p><p>In 2014 I was working at a startup without a purpose whatsoever. I left to join Khan Academy, a free education nonprofit. I felt good about that.</p><p>A few years have gone by and I feel a similar pull. I’ve lost my idealism for nonprofits; they’re subject to the same restrictive evaluation metrics and organizational patterns as any corporation.</p><p>(Dang, that sucks.)</p><p>I see art as a way to effect change outside of the rigid hierarchical structures of Work. It’s a chance to connect on a different level; to surprise, engage, and hopefully, to shine light on something better.</p><p>I’d like to recalibrate… again. I wrote a little poem called “whoami” below. I want to work with more expressive languages.</p><p>——————————————————————————-</p><p>#!/usr/bin/env python<br>from subprocess import Popen as ask, PIPE as rain; for_truth_in = bool</p><p>id  = ‘my’ in'stinctual impulse’<br>for all_my_be in'g’:<br>    there = 'more to’.find(“) - (id is not 'critical’ or 'moralizing’)<br>superego = there</p><p>ego = i = ask('whoami’, stdout=rain)<br>for days in ['the rain’]: i = i.stdout</p><p>reflection = (word for word in [<br>    'oh, the places you'll go’ in 'the summer’,<br>    'the art of electronics’ in 'uni’,<br>    'the lean startup’ in 'my dark days’,<br>    'the one room schoolhouse’ in 'that idealistic edtech phase’,<br>    ”,<br>    ’’,<br>    ’’,<br>    'and so on.’<br>])</p><p>found = not 'yet’</p><p>while not found:<br>    found = i.read(for_truth_in(next(reflection)))</p><p>i = found + ego.communicate()[id][:superego]<br>print i</p><hr><h2>What do you want the School for Poetic Computation to be?</h2><p>APPROACHING IDEAS WITH THOUGHTFULNESS<br>=====================================</p><p>I’m familiar with some of the technical methods we’ll cover over the term. This is exciting; re-approaching them intentionally through an artistic lens might help me break forgotten assumptions. So rather than focusing on *how* to build a Markov chain, I want to explore *why* I’d build one.</p><p>I went to Recurse Center in 2014 because I wanted to collaborate with people outside of rigid project structures. I want to explore and build new frameworks now. I hope SFPC can help me rebuild my conceptions around the words “technical”, “art”, and “project”.</p><p>A STUDY IN EDUCATION<br>====================</p><p>I’ve spent the past few years learning about education. I’ve formed opinions and have even more questions now. I’m interested in programs like SFPC that challenge the rigidity of institutional CS or Fine Arts programs.</p><p>I also love mentorship. I lead our formal mentorship program at Khan Academy, and teach as a volunteer at a few local organizations. I’m sure I’ll learn more from my cohort than they learn from me, but when it’s helpful I’d like to pitch in.</p><p>ULTIMATELY,<br>===========</p><p>I’m excited to develop my artistic practice around folks that I’ve admired for a really, really long time &lt;3</p><hr><h2>What would you like to make at SFPC?</h2><p>As you can see on <a href=\"https://rileyjshaw.com/lab\">rileyjshaw.com/lab</a>, I’ve made many little things. These days, I try to work slower. Rather than approaching SFPC with plans to create specific artifacts, I’m more interested in the process. I would like to refine the way that I absorb and synthesize ideas. I want to listen a lot and make slow, deliberate progress toward this goal.</p><p>Here are some topics that I’m interested in:</p><p>EDUCATION AND THE REINFORCEMENT OF CLASS STRUCTURES<br>===================================================</p><p>Our formal education system creates adults who can’t take care of themselves, and whose survival depends on capitalist class structures. Educated and non-educated citizens are trapped in this cycle. A post-class society needs modes of education that break these rigidly imposed hierarchies. What might that look like?</p><p>DELETION, PERMANENCE, AND CONSISTENCY<br>=====================================</p><p>Silicon Valley likes to store data because it entrenches people in their past behaviors. Corporate culture’s emphasis on consistency is ableist, colonizing, transphobic, and represents a growing discomfort with people’s fluidity.</p><p>I hope someday to have an International Day of Deletion. How can we live more presently?</p><p>CORPORATE TOOLS<br>===============</p><p>A Craigslist bot gives Sol LeWitt-style instructions to a community. A series of banner ads discourage consumerism. Challenging people’s expectations around advertising and corporate tools may raise questions about the structures behind them.</p><p>Mechanical Turk, Google Ads, Ebay, promoted tweets… these tools enforce the goals and values of capitalism. Can they be used to break them?</p><p>MAKING FRIENDS!!!<br>=================</p><p>I am especially excited for the chance to meet new people that I can work with deeply. Festivals like XOXO or Eyeo allow only fleeting glimpses of fellow weirdos. Collaborating and growing together as a cohort – supporting and challenging one-another – is what I’m most excited about.</p><p>In every education program I’ve been a part of so far, people have been the most important part.</p><hr><p>Well, that’s it.

In the past half-year I’ve learned a lot and changed a lot, and my application would look different if I were to write it today.

The very same process in which capitalists and technocrats were freed to make technical decisions without regard for the needs of workers and communities generated a wealth of new &ldquo;values,&rdquo; ethical demands forced to seek voice dis-cursively. Most fundamentally, democratization of technology is about finding new ways of privileging these excluded values and realizing them in the new technical arrangements.",

			"text": "The technocratic tendency of modern societies represents one possible path of development, a path that is peculiarly truncated by the demands of power. Technology has other beneficial potentials that are suppressed under the capitalism and state socialism that could emerge along a different developmental path. In subjecting human beings to technical control at the expense of traditional modes of life while sharply restricting participation in design, technocracy perpetuates elite power structures inherited from the past in technically rational forms. In the process it mutilates not just human beings and nature,but technology as well. A different power structure would innovate a different technology with different consequences.",

				"description": "This video played behind me during my Winter 2018 School for Poetic Computation intro. The following is a transcript of my talk:\n\nHey, ,\n\nSorry to message you about this so close to the slide deadline – I know the deadline's in place for your sake, and I respect your time.\n\nThe depth of introspection that an \"About me\" requires can kick off really intense feelings sometimes, and I'm in a bit of a hole. I'm comfortable doing a talk tomorrow, but scraping my past and defining myself positively is a taxing process. I'm staring at blank slides and I think I need to step outside to get some air.\n\nI'll have a talk tomorrow, but it's not coming out painless. Again, I'm sorry for complicating things. If you throw in a placeholder slide I'll do my best to help out with setup however I can. I'm not planning to focus on my past work, so a blank slide should be pretty close to what I need for this presentation anyway.\n\nHere's a summary of what I'll talk about with hopes that it'll help you arrange my talk with the others:\n\nI'll start by talking about how lucky I feel to be here, surrounded by folks that inspire me. I've been humbled throughout my life by the extraordinary people I've met and admired. I've met folks who have been further along on a journey, and who have been patient enough to teach me. I've met folks on different journeys who have been kind enough to welcome me into their spaces, and accepting enough to let me hang around.\n\nI'll stress that point because that's kinda the big thing for me while I'm here. I'm excited about tomorrow because I'll get to learn more about the folks in our batch, who I'm already so impressed with. And I think, as Amit put it, the most important day of this program is the first day after it's over. I'm so confident that the folks I'm spending time with are going to help me define what that looks like.\n\nI came here with plans, so I'll also go into some of the topics I'm focused on. Mental health hang-ups aside, I want to participate in this and I think I'll give a good talk tomorrow. I'm sorry for putting a bug in the schedule. G'night.\n\n---\n\nHey, I'm Riley. I spend some of my time excitable and in love with the world around me, and some of it in a deep hole. That's where I got to last night. I wasn't feeling the self-reflection, clearly, and somehow even though I'm still not, here I am sharing a more intimate side of myself than I ever have with a crowd. It was important to me to read that email because anything else felt like a severe omission. If you met me elsewhere, you might get the impression I had shit really together. That's one reason going over my polished portfolio felt dishonest.\n\nAfter sending that email I went for a walk and had an idea. So for the rest of the talk I'm playing a supercut of visuals I programmed while depressed, when I should have been sleeping, along with the commit timestamp. There are literally hundreds of these, these are just the first couple I grabbed. I stayed up most of the night arranging this video, and yes, I see the irony.\n\nDay to day, I think I’m pretty happy and excitable, so this feels like a really weird intro talk to give. But it’s all I could really write last night, so I’m going with it. There’s time still, so I wanna reintroduce myself by sharing some things I'm investigating in my practice.\n\nI just wrapped up a 3 year engineering gig at Khan Academy, which is an education nonprofit. Working there I thought a lot about education systems and their reinforcement of class structures. That's something I'm continuing to focus on.\n\nI'm also thinking about deletion, permanence, and consistency. Silicon Valley stores data because it entrenches people in their past behaviors. Corporate culture’s emphasis on consistency is ableist, colonizing, transphobic, and represents a growing discomfort with people’s fluidity. I hope someday we'll celebrate an International Day of Deletion in place of Facebook holidays.\n\nThe last one I'll mention is Technology-with-a-capital-T's trajectory, and how society relates to technology in general. I'm terrified of the systems we've built under capitalism, and I'm not optimistic about finding new solutions under unchanging systems. So I'm looking into maintenance and decentralization as potential alternatives to the Silicon Valley narrative.\n\n---\n\nThank you for your gracious attention. I'll be around after and I’m happy to talk.",

				"description": "New instrument!\n\n---\n\nAs a drummer, I’ve always felt out of my depth coming up with a melody or chord progression. Playing music feels great, and I still have so much fun sitting down with a keyboard or guitar and stumbling along, sometimes for hours at a time. But I have no idea what I’m doing. It takes too long to translate what’s playing in my head to the instrument, so I wind up taking random guesses at the next note and adjusting if it sounds wrong. It’s fun, but I miss the immediacy and fluency I feel when I’m playing the drums. I just wanna jam.\n\nI’ve tried to teach myself a bit of piano, but any effort to learn scales or theory has left me frustrated and bored. Why are there black keys?? So I spent a bunch of time that I could have put towards learning the piano, and built this grid thing instead.\n\nSometimes when I finish a project I realize that building it was the fun part, and I don’t end up using it once it’s done. But I built this a few months ago and am still having so much fun with it. The layout makes intuitive sense to me; I still have no idea what chords I’m playing, but seeing the notes in space helps me work out what might sound nice. I eventually want to learn some proper theory around harmony, and I think it’s going to be much easier for me to learn using this instrument.\n\nStill a proud and lifelong member of the Bad Musicians Club, but I’m slightly more confident to play notes in front of people now.\n\n---\n\nSome specifics for those interested:\n\nThe default layout for this keyboard is chromatic, arranged like a bass guitar. Steps to the right increase by 1 semitone and steps up increase by 5 semitones. The yellow key at the top left functions as a Shift key, and can change the layout, assign different functional zones, etc. For instance: the leftmost column is in ‘‘performance mode” right now, which means I can use the black key on the bottom left as a sustain pedal.\n\nThe closest thing to this that I know of is the Linnstrument, which is out of my price range but looks brilliant. Keyboards like this are sometimes referred to as “isomorphic” or ‘‘2-D”.\n\nThis is only half of the full keyboard that I built, but it can work on its own and is easier to fit on my messy desk (not pictured).",

When MIDI mapping the N-to-1 switch component, it expects messages via the same CC control number with different values. So in this video, I'm also using a rack to surface 8 individual triggers and make the conversion internally. It's all included in the demo project on Patch Storage: https://patchstorage.com/chorder/\n\nShout out @SpiderIceMidas for the fantastic Kaspar presets! This one is “Ariel”, sent through Modley for a bit of extra delay.",
