# Project scraper

The projects on my site are automatically scraped and formatted at publish time
using the scripts in this directory. Read more about my reasoning below, or
skip to the [directory structure](#structure).

## Why?

Gatsby’s source and transformer plugins are powerful, and I used them in the
initial development of this site. I eventually decided that separating my
collection process would be good for flexibility, control, and offline work.

### Flexibility

GraphQL’s filters and transforms are powerful, and Gatsby’s APIs add more
options for how data is fetched, cached, and transformed. However, complicated
or non-standard data transforms and sanitization are much easier outside of
Gatsby’s ecosystem. For instance, the API starts to feel clunky for one-off
treatment of specific content nodes,

### Control

I’ve had a good experience with Gatsby but I may decide to migrate my site to
another platform or format someday. Keeping my data entirely separate from the
from the site’s framework makes migrating my data as easy as copy/pasting this
directory. It’s just a few JS files!

### Offline

Gatsby stores requests made through its source plugins in the `.cache`
directory by default. The `.cache` directory is deleted after:

- `gatsby clean` is called.
- `package.json` changes, for example a dependency is updated or added.
- `gatsby-config.js` changes, for example a plugin is added or modified.
- `gatsby-node.js` changes, for example if a new Node API is invoked.
- …etc.

I found I was frequently triggering `.cache` wipes during development. At best
this meant I was pinging APIs and atom feeds more than necessary. At worst, it
made working offline with project data impossible.

## Directory structure

Here’s how the scraper is organized for now:

```
scraper-utils.js
	The megafile to replace Gatsby’s source plugins. This contains functions to
	pull project data from all online sources and save them into `_generated/`.

run-scraper.js
	A one-line script to actually kick off the scraper. Allows parts of
	`scraper-utils.js` to be `require`d without kicking off unwanted
	side-effects.

_generated/
	Files generated by `run-scraper.js` above. DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES
	MANUALLY! They will be overwritten.

	tags.json
		A full list of tags from `../sources/tags.json`.tagInfo, flattened into
		an array so GraphQL can ingest it.

	scraped-projects-raw.json
		Not quite the raw response, but pretty close. This file
		contains all the data that I may decide to use someday, but
		haven’t yet. Organized by `type` in a nested object.

	scraped-projects-formatted.json
		Standardized into a smaller format that can be smashed together with
		`curation/` data. Flattened into an array with `type` annotations on
		each node, as well as unique, unchanging project IDs (`UID`).

	combined-projects.json &
	combined-quotes.json
		The entire collection of content listed in sources/ combined with
		whatever the scraper pulled down, run through tweaks.js etc. This is
		the complete list, so it’s probably what you’ll want to ingest outside
		of this package.

curation/
	This is where all custom curation and processing go, eg. tagging content.
	Projects are modified based on their generated UID.

	tweaks.js
		Mainly for one-off changes eg. fixing formatting errors from immutable
		online sources. This file can also be used to apply changes on groups
		of files.

	generate-tags.js
		Flattens `../sources/tags.json`.tagInfo into an array so GraphQL can
		ingest it.

	server.mjs
		A simple express server that allows devtools like the project tagger to
		directly edit JSON files (eg. `../sources/tags.json`). Curation tools
		are currently located in /src/pages/curate/, and can be accessed from
		localhost:8000/curate/<tool> after running `npm run curate`.

sources/
	Offline data files and collections to compliment the online data cached in
	`_generated/`.

	projects.json
		A hand-curated list of projects that aren’t (yet) captured by the
		scraper.

	quotes.json
		Quotes I like. Some quotes are scraped from online sources, but most of
		them live here.

	tags.json
		Contains an object split into:
			tagInfo: A list of project tags, with descriptions and other useful
			info.
			taggedProjects: projects linked with their associated tags.

test/
	Quick test files to ensure data is downloaded without any dropped nodes,
	UIDs are unique, etc.
```
