I made this website in early 2014 to document projects I worked on at [Hacker School](https://www.recurse.com/). Though I’ve changed a lot since then and worked on all sorts of problems, the site hasn’t updated to reflect that.

After three years working on Khan Academy’s engineering team, I left to pursue art and activism full time at the [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/). I’m posting snippets at [sfpc.rileyjshaw.com](https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com).

At some point I’ll update this site to reflect my current focus. For the time being, I’ve merged my waaay outdated portfolio into [the lab](/lab).

For more about what I’m focusing on at the moment, you can check out my [application to SFPC](https://sfpc.rileyjshaw.com/post/171435065582/my-school-for-poetic-computation-application). It’s half a year out of date at time of writing, but that’s more recent than anything else on this website. 😅

Talk “soon”!
